A C program to simulate Conway's game of life.

Simulates n by n cells undergoing the game of life.
Each cell is either populated or unpopulated, or alive or dead.
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors die.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors also die.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors live.
Borders of the cells wrap around.
